This is the LogCarp module for perl,
providing additional streams for logging and debugging.

To install these modules, cd to the directory that this README file is
in and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

Documentation for these modules is part of the files themselves using
the pod (Plain Old Documentation) format, and can be read using the
pod2man and pod2html programs that come with perl.  To convert
them into manual page format, type something like the following:

	pod2man LogCarp.pm > LogCarp.man

To convert it into HTML format, type:

	pod2html LogCarp.pm

(pod2html creates an HTML file named LogCarp.pm.html)
