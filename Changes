Revision history for Perl extension CGI::LogCarp.

Note:
There were some MAJOR changes between 1.05 and 1.11.
Namely, the syntax of the 'use' statement has change significantly.
you should now 'use CGI::LogCarp qw( :STDLOG );' to get the STDLOG features,
and :STDBUG for STDBUG features (debugmsg debugmsgout DEBUGLEVEL etc.).

I'm sorry, but I had to break earlier code in order to do this module
the way I am doing it now.
