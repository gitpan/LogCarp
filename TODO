Minor Issues or Wishes
----------------------

- Unfortunately the obvious choice for sending a message to the STDLOG stream
'log' has already been taken, and conflicts with the math function of the same
name. So, I've decided to use 'logmsg' instead, but I'm open to other ideas.

- Locks are fine grained
Do we need a higher level lock/unlock around a block of messages?
e.g.: lock \*STDLOG; iterated_log_writes @lines; unlock \*STDLOG;

- The locking code could probably be made more portable.

- Flesh out the test code.
I've got a few done, but want to test die and exercise all methods and streams in combination.

- Split or move documentation to end of source to speed parsing.
I really don't like the idea of the docs and the code being separate,
but once this stabilizes some more, I'll look at this again.

- Stack signal handlers or don't care and override anyway?

- See about how to make STDBUG and STDLOG truly globals like STDERR and STDOUT.
Currently trying to fake some of this with Symbol.pm, but comments indicate
this is not the ripest fruit on the tree.
