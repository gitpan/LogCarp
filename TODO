Minor Issues or Wishes
----------------------

- Unfortunately the obvious choice for sending a message to the STDLOG stream
'log' has already been taken, and conflicts with the math function of the same
name. So, I've decided to use 'logmsg' instead, but I'm open to other ideas.

- Locks are fine grained
Do we need a higher level lock/unlock around a block of messages?
e.g.: lock \*STDLOG; iterated_log_writes @lines; unlock \*STDLOG;

- The locking code could probably be made more portable.
